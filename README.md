# agent_convomem_search_math

This is a simple demonstrator to show the use of a conversational chat agent which has session memory and has the ability to answer questions related to current events and maths. It uses a google search api and llm math chain as tools.

I plan to build a basic UI to interact with it,later I will also look to add a voice to voice solution using whisper api and eleven labs.
